TileGame
by Jayde Dragyn

A simple tile game where touching a tile changes the colors of that tile, and
the surrounding tiles.  The game begins with all tiles the starting color, and
the goal is to change all the tiles to the final color.

Difficulty levels include changing the size of the board and how many colors
the tiles will cycle through.  If a tile is the final color and is touched, or
caused to change again by touching a neighboring tile, that tile will change
to the starting color.

Board sizes are 3x3, 3x5 and 5x5.
Tile color cycles are 2 colors, 3 colors or 6 colors.
